# batch-generation
The purpose of this project is to reduce time auditing batch files from 15-30 minutes a batch to less than a minute each. The pilot for this project is SGD/MSD (sliding glass/multi-slide doors) since the batch files produced for this production line come in with the most errors. Creating a temporary fix for this can save days worth of time.
